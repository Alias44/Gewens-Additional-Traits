    <description>Have you ever felt that there aren't enough traits to immersify your game-play? Well, I've got just the mod for you with Additional Traits!

Original Description by Gewen: This mod adds (46) new traits to the game. May conflict with mods that modify traits or thoughts.

Changelog:
v3.1.1
Changed defNames to avoid/fix collisions with other mods that add traits
Added patch to handle the transition to the new defsNames

v3.1.0
Added mod settings. Traits (or entire files of traits) can now be enabled or disabled from within the mod (a game reboot is required for changes to take effect (Please note that disabling any traits currently in use by your save will cause a \"Could not load reference to RimWorld.TraitDef named\" error on reload for each trait disabled. These errors can safely be dismissed and will not reoccur after saving again. Anyone that previously had a disabled trait will be randomly assigned a new one in its place.))
Several traits have been relabeled
Several traits have had their descriptions revised
All traits that grant bonuses to skills now require that the person is actually capable of doing that skill

v3.0.1
Moved Heroes+Gods traits to a separate file for easy deletion by those that think they are over powered

v3.0 (by Alias)
Updated to 1.0
Diplomacy and Recruitment merged into NegotiationAbility
Custom thought worker written for pervert (because ugly people aren't all perverts...)
Cold-hearted trait removed (commented out) as it was a virtual clone of psychopath
Healthy trait similarly removed for its similarity to super-immune
Profession traits now require that the pawn be able to actually do the task related to the trait (no more shooting professionals that won't touch a gun)
Similarly, shooting traits now conflict with brawler
New trait: Morbid: Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. NAME is fascinated by corpses and decay
Unnecessary clone of thoughtDefs removed and converted to xpath
About rearranged to be more organized

v2.1 (by Swenzi)
Updated to B18
GiftImpact Offset changed to Diplomacy Power (GiftImpact stat was removed)
Professional Stonecutter trait was removed (StonecuttingSpeed stat removed)

v2.0 (Professions and Heroes!)
Careful Surgeon: NAME is a pretty good surgeon, but they takes a bit more time to complete an operation.
Professional Stone Cutter: NAME likes to cut boulders down to size. Their stone cutting speed is greatly increased, but their lack of passion for other crafts slows them down.
Professional Butcher: NAME likes dressing animals. Their butchering speed is greatly increased, but they're terrible with mechanoids.
Professional Tailor: NAME likes making apparel. Their tailoring speed is greatly increased, but they're terrible with smithing.
Loved By Animals: NAME is loved by animals, but people don't feel quite the same.
Avid Artist: NAME is an avid artist. Their sculpting speed is greatly increased, but they have a weaker constitution and mind.
Genius Researcher: Strange new ideas just appear in the mind of NAME. Researching new technology comes easily to NAME, but they always seem distracted.
Greenest Thumb: NAME has a passion for gardening. They know exactly what a plant needs to grow happily.
Efficient Builder: NAME doesn't like to waste materials. They take care in their work.
Fast Miner: NAME knows how to exploit the cleavage of rocks. They don't understand why plants are so much more fragile, though.
Hercules: Brave NAME, born with impossible strength and force of will.
Mercury: It is said that NAME can leap the space between lightning and thunder, outfox the fox king, and reach tomorrow before the sun.
Aphrodite: So wondrous is NAME to behold that one look can inspire tears, desire, jealousy, and love.
Ares: Feared by his enemies and worshipped by warriors, NAME is a bloodthirsty God of War.
Artemis: NAME's natural instinct to protect and nurture the people led HIM to champion the hunt.
Vulcan: NAME crafts with fire and forge as an artist would with paint and brush.
Imhotep: NAME sends to sleep those who suffer, the new day bringing good health to them.
Sylvanus: Companion to all woodland creatures, both mundane and fantastic, NAME protects and nurtures those that respect HIS domain.
Achilles: Said to have been dipped in the river of death, NAME seems invulnerable in battle.
Odysseus: Craftier by far than any mortal man, NAME is also a very capable warrior.

v1.1 Traits:
Cold-hearted: Lacks empathy, but more or less blends in with society.
Pervert: Unaffected by nudity or sharing a bedroom with strangers. Creepy.
Heavy sleeper: Unaffected by people stomping around next to them while they're sleeping.
Introducing THOUGHTS!
Traits now include mood and relationship impacting effects!
